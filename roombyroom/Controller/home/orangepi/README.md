## The System Controller

Here are all the files that are installed on the system controller, a small computer located in the premises where heating is being managed. The controller is currently specified as being an Orange Pi Zero 2.

Several configurations are currently included in this repository and not all will continue. The final product will have a GUI interface integrted with the controller, as a single unit suitable for use in a domestic environment. Until then, the instructions here are just an outline for the benefit of experienced users willing to dive into the repository.

To install RBR, flash the Debian operating system (desktop version) onto an SD card  of 16GB or bigger. Attach a USB keyboard and mouse to the Pi (this will require a USB 3-port adapter), insert the SD card and power up. Use the GUI to connect to your wifi router. You can then do everything on the device itself or log in over SSH. Download the appropriate setup script and run it. If in doubt, send a message to [info@rbrheating.com](mailto:info@rbrheating.com) and we'll do what we can to help.
