## The Timing Period Editor

~img:periodedit.jpg:50% center~
The Schedule Editor shows all the timing periods defined for the selected room. Tap any one of them to go into editing mode, where it is replaced by a row of controls:

This shows the starting time for the selected period and the temperature that applies for that period.
Tap the arrows to adjust the hour, minute or temperature, or the red cross to delete this timing period. When you tap another row the changes you made will be copied back to the information row and a new editor opened.

At the bottom, the green plus sign adds a new timing event and the Save button saves the current state showing. Tap Cancel to exit without making any changes and Help to see this page.

Every time you make a change to the time the system will resequence the timing periods if necessary to keep them in ascending order.
