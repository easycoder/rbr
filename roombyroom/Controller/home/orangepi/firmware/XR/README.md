# Chained wi-fi networking for control systems
This is the source code for a networking strategy for controlling simple wifi devices distributed over a large physical area, without the need for repeaters. The code is Micropython and the system was designed for a network of 4MB ESP8266 devices. It was originally developed for a home heating control system but is equally well suited to handling the needs of industrial heating, irrigation or similar systems, where several devices need to be controlled centrally.

There is a full article describing the system, at [DEV.to](https://dev.to/gtanyware/chained-wi-fi-networking-for-control-systems-5hf2)

The files in this directory are all described in outline in the article.
