## Getting started

Please note: These pages are fairly complex and are written for DIY enthusiasts who are comfortable using computers in text mode (like DOS) without a graphical screen or mouse. We are developing a pre-built controller with a far simpler setup procedure and will be offering this for sale in the future. Please [contact us](mailto:info@rbrheating.com) if you would like to know more.

The steps to get your own RBR system set up are as follows:

  1. Get the necessary parts. These are:
    - A Raspberry Pi computer or equivalent, to act as the system controller
    - One or more ~sid:RoomKit:Room Kit~s

    - A smartphone to handle the user interface
