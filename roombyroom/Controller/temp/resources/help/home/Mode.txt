## The Mode dialog

~img:mode.jpg:center 50%~

This dialog lets you select the operating mode for a room. It can be one of:

  1. On - using a target temperature
  1. Boost - as for On but for a specified period
  1. Timed - using a timing schedule
  1. Off - permanently off

## "On" mode
This mode provides up and down buttons to let you choose the target temperature you want for the room. Tapping the buttons raises or lowers the target by half a degree at a time. When you reach your desired termperature tap the text/icon button on the left.

## "Boost" mode
This mode lets you override the system and turn on a radiator for a fixed period; 30 minutes, 1 hour or 2 hours, using the target temperature set for On mode. Tap the period you want then tap the text/icon button on the left. On the home screen the mode button shows the remaining time, then at the end of the boost period the system reverts to its previous mode. It only makes sense to use Boost to override Timed or Off modes.

## "Timed" mode
This mode runs according to a schedule of times and temperatures of any complexity, that you specify in this webapp. On the right is an edit button:

that when clicked opens the Periods screen:

Each of the rows describes a timing period. The rows are kept in time order by the app itself. When you tap one of the rows it changes to an editing row:

Use the buttons to adjust the time and temperature, then either tap another row or the Save button.

Timed mode has a button labeled `Advance` (shown at the top of this page). When you tap this the system remains in timed mode but advances to (brings forward) the state for the next timing period. If you open the dialog again the text will change colour to indicate the advance is active. Tap the button again to cancel the advance. The advance cancels itself automatically when the next timing period starts.

## "Off" mode
In this mode the heating will always be off in the room.
