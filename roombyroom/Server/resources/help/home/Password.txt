## Setting the system password

When a system registers itself with the web server at `https://rbrcontrol.com` it receives back a password, which is saved as a `password` file in the system controller. You can list this file from the command-line interface by typing `cat password`. When you have done this, the **RBR** webapp saves it in the browser's private storage area along with the MAC address. Unless you clear the browser cache it will remain there indefinitely.

If you need to have the password sent again, tap `Cancel` and you will be returned to the previous screen to re-enter your email address.
