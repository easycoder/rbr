## Setting the system password

When a system registers itself with the web server at `https://rbrcontrol.com` it receives back a password, which is saved as a `password` file in the system controller. You can list this file from the command-line interface by typing `cat password`.

In order for your smartphone to send messages to the website it must also use the same password. If you are evaluating **RBR** without any hardware you will have given an email address instead of a MAC address and the server will have sent you an email containing the password.

Whichever of the above scenarios applies, the **RBR** webapp needs to know the password, which it saves in the browser's private storage area along with the MAC or email address. Unless you clear the browser cache it will remain there indefinitely.
