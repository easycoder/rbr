## Welcome to RBR

**RBR** is **Room By Room control**, a smart heating system that gives you individual control over the temperature of every room in your house, throughout the day. The aim is to reduce cost by only heating rooms that are in use. Control is from inside or outside the house, using this webapp. **RBR** can be installed as a DIY project or by a professional, and setting up requires little more than the ability to wire up a plug. For those into coding, all the software is Open Source; that is, freely available for modification or improvement.

The system is based on off-the-shelf items; radiator actuators, relays and temperature sensors and the Help screens here will eventually provide detailed instructions on how to set up and use a system.

Because there is a significant cost in equipping radiators with electric control valves, relays and sensors, we offer the means to evaluate the **RBR** system without having to make any purchases (see ~tid:Evaluate:this page~). This documentation is growing rapidly, so take some time to get generally familiar with it.

To close this Help screen tap the Hamburger menu - the 3 bars at the top right of the screen. You will be asked to supply the MAC address of your system controller. Click the Help button for more information, then close the help and it will repeat the request for the MAC address.

Once you have enered the MAC address you will then be asked for the system password. This dialog also has a Help button for information about where the password can be found.
