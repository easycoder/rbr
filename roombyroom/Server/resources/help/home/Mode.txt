## The Mode dialog

~img:mode.jpg:center 50%~

This dialog lets you select the operating mode for a room. It can be one of:

  1. On - using a target temperature
  1. Timed - using a timing schedule
  1. Off - permanently off

## "On" mode
This mode provides up and down buttons to let you choose the target temperature you want for the room. Tapping the buttons raises or lowers the target by half a degree at a time. When you reach your desired termperature tap the gray area behind the up and down buttons.

## "Timed" mode
This mode runs according to a schedule of times and temperatures of any complexity, that you specify in this webapp. On the right is an edit button:

that when clicked opens the Periods screen:

Each of the rows describes a timing period. The rows are kept in time order by the app itself. When you tap one of the rows it changes to an editing row:

Use the buttons to adjust the time and temperature, then either tap another row or the Save button.

On the mode screen, under the edit icon, is a button labeled `Advance`. When you tap this, the system remains in timed mode but advances to the next timing period. If you open the dialog again the text will show in red to indicate the advance is active. Tap the button again to cancel the advance. The advance cancels itself automatically when the next timing period starts.

## "Off" mode
In this mode the heating will always be off in the room.
