## System overview

The RBR system lets you control any radiator or group of radiators, linking them to a thermometer module in the room being controlled. You can choose to control part or all of a house. The system is based on the [Shelly&trade;](https://shelly.cloud/) range of smart devices, all of which connect to your local Wi-Fi network. A small computer - a Raspberry Pi - serves as the local system controller and the user interface is any computer or smartphone, inside the house or anywhere else in the world.

The RBR system is based on just 2 Shelly&trade; devices. The first of these is the Shelly Humidity and Temperature sensor:

and the second is the Shelly 1 WiFi relay switch:

To control a radiator we need it to be already fitted with a TRV (Thermostatic Valve).The top part of this unscrews and can be replaced by an electric actuator such as the Danfoss 088H3220, available from Amazon:

The actuator is connected to the relay, which is plugged into a mains power socket. Every 10 minutes the thermometer sends its current temperature to the system controller, which runs through a set of rules to decide whether to turn on the relay(s) and sends the appropriate command(s). The system status is sent to a web server, which is monitored by any computer or smartphone running this webapp.
