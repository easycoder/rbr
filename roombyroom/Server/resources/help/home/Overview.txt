## System overview

The RBR system lets you control any radiator or group of radiators, linking them to a thermometer module in the room being controlled. You can choose to control part or all of a house. The system is based on the [Shelly&trade;](https://shelly.cloud/) range of smart devices, all of which connect to your local Wi-Fi network. A small computer - a Raspberry Pi - serves as the local system controller and the user interface is any computer or smartphone, inside the house or anywhere else via the Internet.

The RBR system is based on electric radiator valve actuators. These replace the thermostatic actuators commonly used to control room temperature. It's just a matter of unscrewing the thermostatic actuator and screwing on the eletric one; no plumbing changes are needed. A typical actuator is the Danfoss 088H3220, available from Amazon:~clear~

Amazon also supply alternative models at about half the cost of the Danfoss. These appear to work well too.

You can build one yourself around an Arduino or a Pi Nano, but it's far simpler to use the Shelly 1 relay (pictured), which is controlled by WiFi and is small enough to fit inside a standard junction box:

The actuator is powered from the relay, which is plugged into a mains power socket. Every 10 minutes the thermometer sends its current temperature to the system controller, which runs through a set of rules to decide whether to turn on heating and sends commands to the actuator relay(s). The system status is sent to a web server which talks to the webapp you are using now and enables you to control all aspects of the system.
