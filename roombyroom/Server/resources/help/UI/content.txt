## User Interface

The user interface (UI) for the RBR project is a _mobile webapp_ - a web page optimized to run on a mobile device (smartphone) browser. This avoids the need to download and install a native app.

All the software is written in EasyCoder - an English-like scripting system built to make browser scripting easy. Compared to JavaScript, that is. The reason for this is that JavaScript is a very complex language living in a very complex ecosystem. Beyond a basic level it's really only suitable for professional programmers.  We wanted to make RBR accessible to those with relatively little programming experience and to those for whom programming is not a full-time activity.

This is not to say that RBR itself is simple. All we claim is that you don't have to be a professional to understand the code. The logic is generally straightforward and very few aspects of EasyCoder are hard to grasp, as they are based on English words and phrases with a simple command syntax. Any EasyCoder command can be read out, with a fair chance of an intelligent listener being able to get some idea of what it means, even with no prior training. Very few (if any) other programming languages can claim this.

The following pages describe EasyCoder and how it is used in RBR.
