## Setting up a Room Kit

~img:roomkit.jpg:50% center~
This is a room kit. It comprises a radiator valve actuator powered from a box containing a wifi-controlled relay. It can turn on and off a radiator, under-floor heater grid or any other plumbed item with a 30mm screw fitting. The box has a green indicator to show when the radiator is on, and a 3-way switch allowing full manual override if needed. Also shown in the photo is a Xiaomi Mijia Bluetooth thermometer module.

You can equip as many rooms as you like with room kits. If you wish to leave some rooms controlled by conventional thermostatic actuators, this is no problem. It allows you to evaluate RBR on a room by room basis without the need to splash out on a complete system right at the start.

### Setting up a room kit

There is rarely any need to perform any maintenance on the room kit, but here are some notes:

Each room kit contains a small computer that connects to the system controller by wifi. It also publishes its own wifi hotspot, with its SSID written on a label on the box. The password will have been provided by the system installer. When you connect to the hotspot you will be assigned an IP address that's either 172.24.100.x or 172.24.101 x, where 'x' is a number between 2 and 5. The room kit itself is either 172.24.100.1 or 172.24.101.1. If connect to it at that address it will return a single line of text giving the current status of the device. This includes the SSID and RSSI (signal strength) of its connection to the system controller, which might be via another room kit. If the RSSI is less (more negative) than -100 you should seek advice from the system installer on whether to reconfigure the system, as too low a signal strength will result in poor reliability.

The Mijia thermometer has a battery life of up to a year, after which its screen rapidly dims before communication eventually ceases. At this point, install a new battery. The battery state reported by the device can be read by tapping the temperature oval for that room on the user interface. Both the battery state and RSSI can also be read by tapping the paper and pencil icon then "Show rooom info". To determine the MAC address of the Mijia, use the `nRF Connect` smartphone app.

Note to devlopers: Inside the room kit is a relay board with an ESP-01S processor plugged into it. The latter can be removed and connected to a computer running a suitable program such as Thonny. The firmware inside the ESP-01 is Micropython and you will be able to access all the Python scripts that control the device, as well as its configuration data. The [RBR repository](https://github.com/easycoder/rbr) contains all the source code and documentation.
