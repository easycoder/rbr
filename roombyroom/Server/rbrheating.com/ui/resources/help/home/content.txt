## Smart heating, room by room

The cost of heating is rising fast and there's little sign this will stop any time soon. When considering how to heat your home you'll want to keep the running cost as low as possible, and this means only heating rooms that are being used. Conventional heating control systems either regard the entire house as a single entity, governed by a single timer and thermostat, or as individual rooms whose temperatures are controlled by thermostatic valves but where you have no way to individually adjust the times at which the heating should be on for each room.

**RBR** is **_Room By Room_** - an automated central heating control system with the following key features:

  - Independent control of every room
  - Comprehensive webapp with no download or install needed
  - Control from inside or outside the home
  - Manual or timed with unlimited timing schedules
  - Selectable profiles and calendar

**Room By Room** gives you complete control over each individual radiator from your smartphone or computer, whether you are in the house or not.
