## System overview

The RBR system lets you control any radiator or group of radiators, linking them to a thermometer module in the room being controlled. You can choose to equip part or all of a house with this system. A small computer serves as the local system controller and the user interface is any computer or smartphone, inside the house or anywhere else via the Internet.

The RBR system is based on thermo-electric radiator valve actuators, which replace the thermostatic actuators commonly used to control room temperature. It's just a matter of unscrewing the thermostatic actuator and screwing on the electric one; no plumbing changes are needed. A typical actuator looks like this:~clear~

The box has a neon indicator to show when power is applied to to the actuator, and a 3-way switch to provide manual override if needed. It plugs into a standard wall outlet, communicates by wifi with the system controller and controls the radiator actuator shown in the photo.

Also shown is a Xiaomi Mijia thermometer unit, which regularly sends its current temperature to the system controller, which runs through a set of rules to decide whether to turn on heating and sends commands to the actuator relay(s). The system status is sent to a web server which talks to the webapp you are using now and enables you to control all aspects of the system.
