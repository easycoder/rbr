## The System Controller

The system controller runs continuously, looking after the thermometers and radiators to keep your rooms at their desired temperatures.

The RBR system is fairly complex but we have designed it such that anyone can install and set up their own system. Once set up, the RBR system is quite simple to operate, but as with other complex systems (such as heat pumps or solar panels, for example), most people will probably call in a specialist to set up the system for them. These instructions are for those wishing to do the job themselves (and for those wishing to do it for their own customers). They assume a certain familiarity with the command line and with basic networking principles, but no specialized computing knowledge is required. You will require a computer with an SD card reader/writer. The most complicated part of the process is navigating the admin interface of your Internet router, and because each router model is different this is the one thing for which these instructions can't offer a lot of help.

The system controller can be any computer able to run Python. In practice, the demands made upon it are not great so there are some very low-cost options. Here we provide setup instructions for two low-cost computers; the Raspberry Pi and the Orange Pi.
