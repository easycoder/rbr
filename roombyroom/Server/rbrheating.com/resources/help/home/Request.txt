## Setting the request relay IP address

The Request Relay is an optional relay that is closed when one or more radiator valves are open. Its action is to send a signal to the boiler or heat pump that hot water is needed. This is effectively the same action as that performed by a wired room thermostat and in many cases the relay can be fitted in place of such a thermostat. When all radiators are closed (either because their rooms are in **Off** mode or are up to their desired temperatures) the relay opens and the boiler or heat pump stops heating water and pumping it round the system.

This dialog is asking for the IP address of the relay.
