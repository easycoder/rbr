## Profiles

The *Profiles* feature allows you to set up any number of different room arrangements, modes and timing schedules, each with its own name and properties.

Initially there is just one profile, the Default. You can change the name of the profile; just tap the editing icon.

To add a new profile, tap the green cross and a new row will appear under the present one(s), with its initial contents set to be the same as the default. The new profile can be deleted as well as renamed.

The profile currently in force has its name in green bold type. To select another profile, tap its name.

Each profile acts independently of all the others, so when you make changes to your heating plan, only the current profile is affected. You can change the number of rooms, their order and their names, and you can set up the operating modes with their own sets of timings. So for example you may want a profile that turns off the heating completely when you go out for the day but leaves your normal profile ready for use on every other day. You may want to set up a special profile to use when you have to make an early start in the morning, so the heating comes on earlier than usual. You may find you have a need for a lot of special profiles and there's no limit to how many you can add.
