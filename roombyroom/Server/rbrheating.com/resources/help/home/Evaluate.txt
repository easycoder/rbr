## Evaluate the RBR system

If you are unsure whether this system is for you, try evaluating it, as follows.

In normal use, RBR (Room By Room) is controlling real hardware and requires the MAC address of your system controller to be provided. The RBR website acts as a bridge between your mobile phone and the controller, allowing messages to flow back and forth, and the MAC address is key that identifies your system. If you don't have a system controller then you don't have a MAC address, so here's a way to try out the system without committing yourself to hardware purchases.

Instead of giving a real MAC address, type `DEMO` in the MAC box. Once you've done this you can add rooms just as if you were working with a real physical system. The webapp will simulate heating being on or off in the rooms you specify and you can try out all the features of the webapp.
