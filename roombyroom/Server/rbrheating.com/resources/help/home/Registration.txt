Every computing device on the Internet needs a unique address to distinguish it from all the others. So the network hardware - Ethernet or Wifi - has a "MAC address" that's different for each device. The system controller knows this MAC address and uses it when talking to the web server and database.

When a system registers itself with the web server at `https://rbrheating.com` it receives back a password, which is saved as a `password` file in the system controller. You can list this file from the command-line interface by typing `cat password`. When you have done this, the **RBR** webapp saves it in the browser's private storage area along with the MAC address. Unless you clear the browser cache it will remain there indefinitely.

If you need to get the MAC address and/or password from your system controller, connect to it using SSH and give these commands:

```
cat mac
cat password
```

The MAC address is like a kind of password. Do not reveal it to anyone unless you want to allow them to manage your system. There is no way to change the MAC address other than by replacing the hardware of the network interface, which may well be part of the main computer board.

If you want to evaluate this webapp without setting up any real hardware, type `DEMO` in the MAC input field. See ~tid:Evaluate:this help page~.
