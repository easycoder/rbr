## Evaluate the RBR system

If you are unsure whether this system is for you, try evaluating it, as follows.

In normal use, RBR (Room By Room) requires the MAC address of your system controller to be provided. The RBR website acts as a bridge between your mobile phone and the controller, allowing messages to flow back and forth, and the MAC address is key that identifies your system. If you don't have a system controller then you don't have a MAC address, so here's an alternative that lets you evaluate the system without committing yourself to hardware purchases.

Instead of giving a MAC address, type your email address in the MAC box. Our website will send you an email containing a 6-digit numeric 'password'. The MAC screen will show a box for you to type or paste this code into, then it will act as though a valid (unique) MAC had been given.

Once you've done this you can add rooms just as if you were working with a real physical system.
