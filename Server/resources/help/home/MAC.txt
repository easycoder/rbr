## Setting the MAC address

Every computing device on the Internet needs a unique address to distinguish it from all the others. So the network hardware - Ethernet or Wifi - has a "MAC address" that's different for each device.

The MAC address has the following form:

xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx

and can be found on any Linux computer by typing 'ip address'.

In among the wealth of information that returns are the MAC addresses of all of the network interfaces on your computer. If you are using a wired connection, the one you want is in the block that deals with the Ethernet port. This is often labelled "eth0". If you are using WiFi it will be in the block that describes the wireless interface, which might be labelled "wlan0".

If you have a system running you will also find a file called `mac` in its top-level folder, containing the MAC address.

The MAC address is like a kind of password. Do not reveal it to anyone unless you want to allow them to manage your system. There is no way to change the MAC address other than by replacing the hardware of the network interface, which may well be part of the main computer board.
