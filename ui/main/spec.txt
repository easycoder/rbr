Write a pyside6 program that creates a window 600 pixels wide and 1024 pixels high
Set the background of the window to the image 'backdrop.jpg'
Add a panel to hold a list of rows, with a background color #ffffcc that is visible behind each of the widgets in the row
Create a Row widget class
Each row has a fixed height of 1/12 the height of the list
Set the spacing between rows to 10
Each row should have a 2-pixel gray outline
Each row has 4 elements:
    1 an icon taken from 'timed.png', with no outline
    2 a 'Room Name' label, with no outline
    3 a button with white text '20.0Â°C' and a blue background, with no outline
    4 an icon taken from 'edit.png', with no outline
The Name label should expand to use all spare space
The font height of the Name label should be such as to show at least 20 characters
The font height of the button should be the same as that of the label, and both should be bold
The icon heights should be 3/4 the height of a row
Add each row to the window
Add a 10-pixel spaer, color #ffffcc, above and below the list of rows
Ensure that the panel is just tall enough to hold all the rows, revealing the background in the unused space below it.
